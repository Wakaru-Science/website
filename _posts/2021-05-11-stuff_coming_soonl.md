Vectors $$\mu$$

Definition: Anything with a quantity and a direction is a vector. Vectors are numbers with direction, there are many quantities which are 'not symmetric in space', their value is dependent on direction, part of it's definition and a vector is used to represent that quantitity.

Example: Velocity is a vector because 5 m/s up is not the same as 5 m/s down, eventhought the 'speed' (5 m/s) is the same.

Diagram: A vector is reprentated by an arrow. The tail and head of arrow represents the direction, the length of the arrow represents quantity 'magnitude' of vector. The origin of a single vector does not matter. Vectors are free flowing, it is one of the only objects in physics that you can move around freely in a graph, as long as you do not change  the length and direction of vector.

Code: A vector can be represented as a array in numpy. A vector is not limited to 3 dimensions. 3D vectors in vpython is represented as dsfdfkm.

Notation: Vector has many notations. Usually $$\vec{a}$$ represents vector a. Sometimes, bold a, $$\textbf{a}$$ is also used.

Unit vectors

Definition: What is a hot day in a cold country is, at the same temperature, cold weather in a typically hot country. The 'hot' only has meaning when it is compared to something. 25 degrees celcius only has meaning when 0 degrees celcius is defined. Same way, the magnitude and direction of vector doesn't mean anything unless it is compared to some standard. That is the unit vector. Unit vector has a magnitude of '1' and a direction.

Example: If the 1 is 1 meter, then the car is moving with a magnitude of 25 times unit vector, means 25 m/s. Similarly if the '1' is 1 kilometer/hr, the the car is moving with 25 km/hr. For each dimension there can be only 1 unit vectors, so for 3D, 3 unit vectors, define 3 directions, i.e, up, left and forward. Each having an opposite down, right and backward.

Diagram: Unit vector is drawn the same as a vector, just smaller and usually grouped togeter.

Code: 

Notation: Unit vectors have special notation $$\hat{e}$$, call as 'e cap'. Unit vectors for 3D are $$\hat{i},\hat{j},\hat{k}$$.
